Implements the PageRank algorithm and query-based topic sensitive PageRank

This file uses Python and Numpy to implement Google's PageRank algorithm and query-based topic sensitive PageRank.  The algorithm requires two files: 'example_transistion_matrix.txt' and 'example_doc_topics.txt' in order to run. Unfortunately, these have been lost and I am unsure what format they were in.
